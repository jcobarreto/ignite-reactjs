## üí¨ Project

In this module we will understand how Next.js transforms our way of developing front-end applications and we will discover important concepts like SSR and SSG.
Also, how the front-end has been transformed in recent years with the possibility of having back-end functions (serverless) running in a front-end environment.
Finally, it is very common to develop front-end applications that are not connected to a single back-end today, so here we will understand the concept of JAMStack and how to connect our front-end with a CMS.
